FTMO Bot v3 Mission Plan (v1)

Phase 1: Freeze and Prove
- Lock config and parameters; no mid-attempt changes
- Red-team the risk governor and execution layer
- Forward test on free trial/demo with full monitoring

Phase 2: Go/No-Go Gate
- Require 0 rule breaches and 0 buffer breaches
- Pass-rate threshold from Monte Carlo gate
- Pause and re-validate on regime change or expectancy drop

Phase 3: Challenge
- Trade for minimum trading days with consistent behavior
- Prioritize rule safety over target speed

Phase 4: Verification
- Use the same config and strategy; no tuning
- Maintain minimum trading days and rule safety

Phase 5: Funded
- Switch to funded constraints (news/weekend if standard)
- Focus on survival and repeatable withdrawals

Phase 6: Scale
- Expand only after repeatable pass and withdrawal cycle
- Respect max allocation and account aggregation rules
